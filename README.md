# Local First Software Unconference

_In St Louis after [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/), on Saturday, September 23rd, 2023_

A community event for everybody interested in local-first software in St. Louis, MO.

​We particularly want to bring together people who are actively working on local-first projects — be it building frameworks or tools, developing local-first apps, or doing research in the area. But we also welcome people who are simply curious and want to learn more about the topic.

​The event will have an informal unconference style. Instead of a series of long presentations, we will have self-organized discussion groups around your topics of interest. 

[Registration](https://lu.ma/localfirstswunconf-stlouis) is currently full. [Add your name to the waitlist](https://forms.gle/1CQRCFqrGQKyXb4R9) - we will be doing a final announcement on Friday.

Organizers: 

* Brooklyn Zelenka
* Martin Kleppmann
* Peter van Hardenberg

​Thank you to [Fission](https://fission.codes), [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/), and [DXOS](https://dxos.org/) for sponsoring the event.
