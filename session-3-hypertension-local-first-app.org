* hypertension app
- app: [[simple.org][simple.org]]
- repo: https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-android
- Srihari Sriraman

** background
- most people die from heart disease
  - hypertension (primary)
  - also diabetes
- India: 250M with hypertension
  - not much being done despite simple solution
  - take your medicine regularly... for life
- WHO prioritized this problem
  - Bill & Gates, Chan Zuck, Bloomberg foundations all pitched in
- 5 years in the process
  - bring visibility to the problem
    - especially to the cities govts(?), the people
    - the drugs needed, how it is handled
  - started with population health perspective
    - every individual matters but we're talking about hundreds of
      millions of people, so that's the focus early on
    - so... they started just by *collecting the data*
** the app
- *10 person team*
  - Person heading project is ex-CDC (American, Tom Frieden)
  - Designer, director of product, Danial Burko: Dig.com, drew the first firefox logo
- *needed to work very well offline*
  - a lot of people working on this problem!
    - doctors who report the problem
    - nurses handling the medicine
    - all of this needs to be collected and reported
  - *offline first app*
    - android app
      - data stored locally, occasionally syncs
    - get your info, your data, and then you're done.
    - do not want people stuck on the phone instead of paying attention to the patient.
- Needed to solve the small cases, though
  - instead of having a single phone, would have been nice to have P2P data transfers!
  - ie Nurse scans in the patient and that patient's record/date is
    automatically transferred over to the doctor's phone (who is in
    the back office, etc)
    - didn't get to this part, unfortunately
- *Largely open source*
  - *several awards*
  - for another country to use it, just clone, make the localization requirements, and just re-deploy their own copy on the app store

** problems solved
- search
  - hundred of millions of people
  - several different languages
    - this is not as "fully" solved for non-latin languages, still very hard
- Syncing
  - Offline first but a hosted search solution to bridge the gap for whenever the local data was missing something
    - search was hybrid, did local then online if possible etc
    - once the data was fetched, it was stored and local
  - Deduping by a mix of hard rules but also some heuristics
    - couldn't be heuristic for obvious reasons:
      - Mom & Daughter at same address with extremely similar names. A lot of heuristics would dedup this and that's bad!
** Rollout
- State by state
  - Minister of health of each state
- Previously a paper heavy process
  - very similar to double book accounting
  - entirely eliminated in the clinics that have taken up
  - very successful because the app is so narrow. Only care about hypertension and people being checked for this.
- Adopted in:
  - India
  - Ethopia
  - Bangladesh
  - Sri Lanka
  - Another country, forgot...
*** First app
- wasn't just a success from the start
  - needed to see what distracted the nurses/doctor, what actually helped
** Measuring success
- How many people with hypertension are now under control?
  - X people have hypertension (this is known)
  - Now how many are regularly coming into their clinic?
    - regularly in the last 3 months
- Incentivized to get people back into the clinics
  - Measuring people who don't come back
  - Measuring failed follow ups
** Moving forward
- DHIS2
  - clinical data collection
  - enterprise-ish software
  - open source
  - *not local first*
    - solution? *make it local first*
